         <h3 class="header-2">Dear Pepper,</h3>
         <br />
         <p
            >We are pleased to inform you that because you met all the
            requirements and girlfriend standards, you will be regularized on
            <b>August 28, 2023</b>.</p
         >
         <br />
         <p
            >With that, your probationary period for the girlfriend status with
            your genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist<span
               class="reference-num"
               >[1]</span
            >
            boyfriend will now end. And you will now be a full-time
            girlfriend.</p
         >
         <br />
         <p
            >But now you would be asking, what would change after
            regularization? Nothing really, it just means I really appreciate
            everything you do for us. You always do your best to understand
            where I’m coming from. Thinking about it now, it’s amazing how
            you’re able to put up with my naivety. For the patience and effort
            that you pour into this relationship to work, even though we have
            the biggest differences sometimes. I love how we compromise for
            things to work for the both of us, I really love you for that.</p
         >
         <br />
         <p
            >I know I’m not the best there is, I lack a lot of things. But you
            are my little gem that holds glimmer of inspiration for me to always
            try my best. I want us to grow together and support each other. I
            can’t express with words how much I admire you. I’m really glad I
            found a gem that’s as sublime as you are.</p
         >
         <br />
         <p>I adore you, my dear Pepper. </p>
         <p><b>Happy 1st Anniversary!</b></p>
